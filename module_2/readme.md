The format of the project is Jupiter Notebook. The main task of the project is to make an exploratory analysis of the dataset.

This project shows working with various types of data, mainly nominative and ordinary, as well as numeric. 
Searcing and filling the omissions (NaN) and searching and fixing outliers are present. 
I use visualizing opportunities of several Python libraries to show distribution and correlation with target vector. 
For the conclusions to choose the best-correlated features Student-test is used.

Used libraries: **pandas, itertools, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy.stats.ttest_ind**
